# NewsApp
Final Project for the Android Basics NanoDegree using Loaders, API's and JSON parsing to create an app that tailors to a specific section of News article headings that open a browser 
with intents if a particular news article needs to be studied.

## Installation
* Android Studio 4.1.x
* Android SDK 30
* Download the project as a zip and import it using Android Studio
* You can also download the code directory and open as an existing project
* Android Studio should set everything up automatically
* If there are Gradle Sync Issue, make sure you the project has the same gradle version as the one you are running; you can do this by navigating to the Gradle Scripts in the Porject Explorer: Gradle Scripts-> build.gradle(Module:app_name.app), where app_name is the name of the project/app. In the build.gradle file make sure you have the same SDK version as well as the same gradle version in the android section
